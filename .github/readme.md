# Secure Server for FerrumGate

This is a fork of [OpenSSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable) with extended authentication settings.
Aim to create a secure tunnel to your servers (like ssh..) or clusters like (k8s...) or applications (remote desktop...) or services (mysql,postregsql...) with more control.
